# slack-plugin-docker
Configuration and scripts for building and testing slack-plugin with a Docker container.

**Note** that these scripts and other files were created for a boot2docker environment, so you might need to make some adjustments for other environments. If you do, please build something into the scripts to keep all environments working correctly. An example of boot2docker detection can currently be seen in the start-jenkins.sh shell script.
